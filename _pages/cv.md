### Personal summary

In January 2020 I started as a Research Scientist at Simula Research
Laboratory in the department for Scientific Computing. In relation to me starting at Simula we also established the bioAI group of which I am the group leader.

Before I started as a Research Scientist I was a Postdoc at the department of physics at the University of Oslo. During my postdoc we started the bioAI group

I graduated in 2014 after finishing a master degree in Applied Mathematics at NMBU in Ã…s. 

My fields of interests are computational neuroscience, biologically inspired artificial intelligence, and causal inference.
