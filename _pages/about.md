My name is Henrik Finsberg and I work as a Senior Research Engineer at [Simula Research Laboratory](https://www.simula.no) in the department for [Scientific Computing](https://www.simula.no/research/scientific-computing) and [Computational Physiology](Computational Physiology).

I care deeply about reproducible science and work on promoting best practices when it comes to scientific software development. 

I work on developing of scientific software with applications in computational physiology. See the <a href="{{ base_path }}/software">software section</a> for more information about the software I am working on.

 I am currently involved in a number of projects. See the <a href="{{ base_path }}/projects">project section</a> for more information.

### Short bio
I finished a joint master degree in Applied and Engineering mathematics at NTNU in Trondheim and DTU in Coopenhagen. In 2014 I started my PhD in Scientific Computing at Simula Research Laboratory within the Center for Cardiological Innovation, and defended my PhD in January 2018. Since 2018 I have worked as a Research Enginner at Simula Research Laboratory.

### Outside of Work
Outside of work, I find great joy in running and spending quality time with my family. I am happily married to my wife, Elisabeth, and we are blessed with two beautiful daughters, Ingerid (born in 2014) and Eva (born in 2017).
